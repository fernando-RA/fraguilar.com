description: "At the Art and Technology meeting of 2017 we present the work Ipê. A computer-rendered tree that grows in 72 hours. In the exposure proposal, the tree is born at the opening of the exhibition and grows, develops and only ends its life cycle with the closure of the exhibition, considering the concept of emergence. Elaborated for the exhibition on the School of Fine Arts in Porto, Ipe Amarelo interacts with the biological time in function of the exhibition's space."
